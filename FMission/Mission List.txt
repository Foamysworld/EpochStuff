Mission List:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FMission_Hostage_Rescue.sqf

The mission spawns 2 hostages and 4 guards inside a tent randomly on the map 
somewhere. The objective is to kill all the guards without killing a hostage 
within the allowed time, which is currently set to 20 minutes. The script will 
time out if the time limit is reached and nothing is killed. The loot will only 
spawn AFTER all guards are killed. If at any time during the mission a hostage 
is killed the mission will immediately fail and clear itself from the map.
