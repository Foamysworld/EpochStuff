FMission 1.0
By Foamy

*******************************************************************************
DISCLAIMER:

Do Not Change the base FMission Files. You may use the scripts to make any mission 
type you want but I ask that the base files be left alone so the functionality can 
be maintained.

You may create new files FROM the original files to add on to your own personal Mission 
system but do NOT alter the originals within FMission.

Section 1. FMission Installation Instructions

1. Download the entire FMission folder and all it's contents to your desktop.
2. Copy the FMission folder and all it's contents into the addons folder of your server
3. Move the file "FMission_Launcher.sqf" from the root FMission Directory into your "modules" folder
4. Edit "FMission_Launcher.sqf" to include the missions you want it to cycle.

Example:
_scriptslist = 
		[
		"\z\addons\dayz_server\addons\Fmission\Missions\Foamy\FMission_Hostage_Rescue.sqf",
		"\z\addons\dayz_server\addons\Fmission\Missions\Foamy\mission_name.sqf",
		"\z\addons\dayz_server\addons\Fmission\Missions\Foamy\mission_name.sqf",
		"\z\addons\dayz_server\addons\Fmission\Missions\Foamy\mission_name.sqf"
		];

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 2. Using FMission

1. Fmission is launched by adding an entry to "init.sqf" in the Epoch Scheduler.

The following Example would run the chance to spawn a mission twice an hour.

EpochEvents = [["any","any","any","any",30,"FMission_Launcher"],["any","any","any","any",59,"FMission_Launcher"]];

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 3. Upgrading FMission

As new authors make missions they can create their own folder to hold their missions which 
can be copied into the main "Missions" folder of FMission. This way users can create playlists 
of missions from the folders and authors can make changes to their folder only thus they don't 
change FMission itself.

All new additions to FMission are individual tools thus will not break FMission itself. The tools 
will allow novice scripters to create their own robust missions using the pre-made tools and templates.
